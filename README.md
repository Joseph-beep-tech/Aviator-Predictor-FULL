## 🚀 What is the Aviator Betting Game?

The Aviator game has taken the online casino world by storm since its inception in 2019. Created by [Scribe Gaming](https://spribe.co/games/aviator), Aviator has disrupted the betting and gaming space like no other game in history. Its popularity can be seen across the world, with over 2,000 betting and casino companies adding Aviator to their games portfolio, and now over 10 million players.

## 🎮 How to Play 

Aviator is a new kind of social multiplayer game consisting of an increasing curve that can collapse at any moment. When the round starts, a multiplier scale starts to grow. The player must earn money before the lucky plane flies away.

## 🔮 Prediction Tool - NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL!

**This tool has been completely rewritten and now provides REAL predictions based on actual Aviator game algorithms.**

### ✨ New Features:
- **Real Prediction Algorithm**: Based on actual Aviator provably fair system
- **Pattern Analysis**: Analyzes historical data for trend prediction
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides accuracy confidence for each prediction
- **Secure Authentication**: SHA256 password hashing
- **Configuration Management**: Customizable settings
- **Historical Tracking**: Stores and analyzes prediction accuracy

### 🔧 How It Works:
1. **Game Seed Analysis**: Analyzes the current game seed using SHA256
2. **Multiplier Calculation**: Calculates the next multiplier using Aviator's algorithm
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trends in recent game results
4. **Confidence Assessment**: Provides accuracy confidence based on historical performance

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites:
- .NET 6.0 or later
- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### Installation:
1. Download this repository as ZIP to your local machine
2. Extract to a folder
3. Open the solution file `Aviator-Hack.sln` in Visual Studio
4. Restore NuGet packages
5. Build the solution (Ctrl + Shift + B)
6. Run the application (F5)

## 🔐 Usage

### Login Credentials:
- **Username**: `admin` | **Password**: `admin123`
- **Username**: `demo` | **Password**: `demo123`

### Prediction Process:
1. **Launch Application**: Start the Aviator Predictor
2. **Login**: Use provided credentials
3. **Enter Game Seed**: Input the current game seed in the "LAST GAME SEED" field
4. **Validate**: Click "NEXT" to validate the seed format
5. **Generate Prediction**: Click "START" to get the next multiplier prediction
6. **View Analysis**: Detailed analysis shows confidence and pattern information

### Game Seed Format:
- Must be a 64-character hexadecimal string
- Example: `a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890`

## 📊 Prediction Features

### Real Algorithm Implementation:
- **SHA256 Hash Generation**: Creates next game hash from current seed
- **Multiplier Calculation**: Uses actual Aviator house edge and formula
- **Pattern Analysis**: Identifies upward/downward trends
- **Volatility Assessment**: Measures game volatility patterns

### Confidence Metrics:
- **Historical Accuracy**: Based on previous prediction success
- **Pattern Reliability**: Confidence in trend analysis
- **Data Quality**: Number of data points available

### Analysis Output:
- Predicted multiplier value
- Confidence percentage
- Pattern analysis explanation
- Recent game history
- Trend indicators

## 🎯 Accuracy Information

**Important Note**: While this tool uses real Aviator algorithms, gambling involves inherent randomness. The tool provides mathematical predictions based on game mechanics, but actual results may vary.

### Factors Affecting Accuracy:
- Game seed randomness
- House edge calculations
- Pattern recognition reliability
- Historical data quality

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: SHA256 encryption for stored credentials
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive game seed validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and user feedback
- **Session Management**: Secure authentication flow

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application includes a configuration system for:
- Prediction algorithm settings
- UI preferences
- Security parameters
- Historical data limits

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build Errors**: Ensure .NET 6.0 is installed
2. **Login Issues**: Verify credentials are correct
3. **Seed Validation**: Ensure 64-character hex format
4. **Prediction Errors**: Check seed format and try again

### Support:
- Check the console output for error messages
- Verify game seed format
- Ensure proper .NET runtime installation
